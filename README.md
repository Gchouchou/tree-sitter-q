# tree-sitter-q

kdb q grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

## Sources:

We built the grammar from the official documentation https://code.kx.com/q/ref/
It aims to be as correct as possible but also intentionally not parse
degenerate but valid syntax.
The naming of the nodes still needs work.
